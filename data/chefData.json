        "cooking_method": "Coconut Milk Rice (also called Thengai Paal Sadam in Tamil) is a flavorful and tasty rice based dish featuring rice, onions, coconut milk, mixed vegetables, and flavored with aromatic spices and herbs. This pulao like dish is easy to make, but has a surprising mélange of flavors that can be savored just as it is or with a robust curry, a salad or any other side of your choice. What’s best is the fact that it’s not just vegetarian, but a vegan-friendly recipe too. Best for those times, when you don’t really want to go intricate on cooking yet want to enjoy a deliciously wholesome meal",

        "cooking_method": "What you have here are the basic ingredients of Bangladesh garden salad. Just julienne them all and mix, then sprinkle with lemon, a dash of sugar and salt, and there you go!  You can opt to cut the vegetables differently.I have also seen a variation in the dressing where mustard is added which I tried (anything else I haven’t tried anyway?) and it gives a different kind of satiation in the mouth. What I particularly remember are the strong tastes of mustard and radish that seem to attempt to tame one another.",
